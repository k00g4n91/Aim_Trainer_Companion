# Aim_Training_Companion_Project
W.I.P

## (Must have Kovaaks Aim trainer or a folder of stats to draw from when running this code)

**Be sure to open the entire FOLDER with your IDE. Not just a single file. Otherwise the file paths will be incorrect.**

Hi guys,

  - This is a small prototype project designed to help me track my progress with my aim training.

  - The actual application is in the pygui/ folder. *It will need to be run in conjunction with a terminal in order to see output*

  - The other scripts (main.ipynb + graphs.ipynb) were me just figuring things out.

I hope you enjoy it. I will continue to upload more as I develop the idea further. 

All suggestions are welcome!

Koogan
